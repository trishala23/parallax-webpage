	<h2>Baidyanath Dham</h2>
	<p>Deoghar (the house of Gods) is a centre of peace and harmony that features many socio-cultural and industrial units. It is a popular health resort and an important Hindu pilgrimage.

The ancient temple of Baba Baidyanath (kamana-linga) where one of the twelve jyotirlingas of India is enshrined. Deoghar is believed to be the place where Ravana carrying Lord Shiva on his way to Sri Lanka had stopped, betraying the conditions of a non-stop journey. This failed him in his mission of taking the Lord to Lanka and the Lord remained rooted here.

The place become known as BaidyanathDham after Lord Shiva, also known as Baba Baidyanath. Every monsoon (in the month of Shravan) countless devotees undertake a rigorous 100 kms piligrimage on foot from Ajgaibinath (Sultanganj) to offer holy water to Baba Baidyanath. The pilgrimage is deemed complete with homage paid at Basukinath, almost 43 kms from Deoghar.

Within the precincts of the main temple, there are 12 other temples, dedicated to different Gods, including Lord Mahadeva.</p>

	<h2 align="centre">Dasam Fall</h2>
	<p>Located near the Taimara village in the Ranchi district, Dasham Falls, also known as Dassam Falls, is a spectacular waterfall in the state of Jharkhand which is a tributary of the Subarnarekha River. Cascading down a height of 144 ft., the waterfall boast of utter serenity, peace and calm. The area surrounding the spot is engulfed in rich greenery, that makes it an ideal picnic place in the region. To reach the spot, you will have to climb a flight of stairs. You can also stop in between and stare at the gorgeous scenery surrounding it.

The waterfall is basically a Nick Point, also known as Knick Point, which means that it has been developed over the years due to the break in the rocky slopes in a longitudinal manner. For the same reason, it is not ideal to swim or to step into the water as the current is strong and the ground is uneven. Other than that, the region echoes with the gurgling sound of water which is like music to the ears, and is perfect to relax and rejuvenate.</p>
